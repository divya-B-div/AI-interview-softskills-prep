AI Interview \& Soft Skills Preparation App



A smart and flexible AI platform designed to help users practice interviews and group discussions in a realistic environment. Users can respond using voice or text, and the AI analyzes all responses silently. At the end of each session, the system provides consolidated feedback covering communication, confidence, content quality, and participation.
